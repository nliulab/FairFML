Mitigating algorithmic disparities is a critical challenge in healthcare research, where ensuring equity and fairness is paramount. Although large-scale healthcare data are available across multiple institutions, cross-institutional collaborations often face privacy constraints, highlighting the need for privacy-preserving solutions that also enhance fairness. In this study, we introduce FairFML, a framework-agnostic solution for fair federated learning (FL), designed to improve algorithmic fairness in cross-institutional healthcare collaborations while preserving patient privacy. We evaluated FairFML using real-world emergency medicine data, demonstrating that it significantly enhances model fairness without compromising predictive performance, yielding results comparable to those obtained through local and centralized analyses. FairFML presents a promising solution for FL collaborations, offering a robust approach to developing fairer models across clinical and biomedical domains.
